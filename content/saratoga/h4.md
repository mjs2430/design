Default browser spacing for the `<h4>` atom should be used unless specifically set at the molecule or organism level. Doing so reduces bloat, given that this atom is used in a couple different scenarios, and allows for cascading to apply properly at that level.

#### Example
<h4 class="serif soft" style="text-transform: none;">Jayhawks back in town, start practicing for Saturday’s Eastern Michigan game</h4>
