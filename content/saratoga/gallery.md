The gallery card can be used in a story, or as a standalone card for sections or gallery detail pages. The package molecule at the bottom is flexible, and elements like the title can be removed in cases where that information isn't available. For examples, check out the [story deck](../decks/story) and the [section deck](../decks/section).

#### EXAMPLE
