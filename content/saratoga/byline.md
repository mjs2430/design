The byline and credit rules should have this standard anywhere attribution applies. This includes articles and all media. The byline should display inline with a caption, when applicable, unless there is not enough room to display the byline in full. If that occurs the whole byline should wrap to a new line.

#### EXAMPLE
<div>
  <p class="byline">By <a href="#">John Doe</a> 
    <span class="credit">SAMPLE NEWSPAPER</span>
  </p>
</div>

#### HTML
```html
<p class="byline">By <a href="#">John Doe</a> 
  <span class="credit">SAMPLE NEWSPAPER</span>
</p>
```
