title: h5
description: Used as labels for headline stacks.
level: atom

---
Default browser spacing for the `<h5>` atom should be used unless specifically set at the molecule or organism level. Doing so reduces bloat, given that this atom is used in a couple different scenarios, and allows for cascading to apply properly at that level.

#### Example
<h5 class="serif" style="text-transform: none;">Jayhawks back in town, start practicing for Saturday’s Eastern Michigan game</h5>

#### CSS
```css
h5, .h5 {
  font: 600 14px/1.2em "McClatchy Serif", serif;
}
```
