The section-nav goes at the top of section pages when there is a manually-filled Nav links group in CUE. It's a siple stack of an expander and icon row with small adjustments. On load, the section nav should be collapsed. If there isn't a filled Nav links group in CUE it should render as a standard h1 with no caret by ommitting the expander class.

On mobile (600px), the section-nav headline reduces in size and the expandable list switches to a vertical stack with center alignment.

#### EXAMPLE

*The section nav is included in the [section deck](../decks/section/) and is better represented there.*

#### HTML

{{< highlight html >}}{{< section-nav >}}{{< /highlight >}}
