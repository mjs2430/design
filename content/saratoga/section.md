The section is a simple and stackable building block to get our standard 1140px wide zone. It also includes 30px of vertical margin to allow easy stacking that follows the design.

If a section needs to go all the way across the screen, the `.full-bleed` class is available to do so. Children are not automatically restricted to keep section flexible, but you can easily do so for each feature.

#### HTML
```html
<body>
  <section> ... </section>
  <section> ... </section>
  <section> ... </section>
  <section> ... </section>
</body>
```
