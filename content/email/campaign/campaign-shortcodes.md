Campaign Shortcodes pull in content blocks, user information, property information, logos, and more. This is a list of items that are used frequently, but is not a comprehensive list.

<div class="note">
In order for Adobe Campaign to properly track any URLs in its tables, the URLs have to be inserted in the tables without <code>https://</code> at the beginning and the <code>https://</code> must be added in the HTML as shown in the list below.
